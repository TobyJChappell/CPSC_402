# Assignment 1
## Specification

DFA diagrams for each question are found in this repository and titled 1.pdf, 2.pdf, and 3.pdf.

## Execution

To compile and execute, type `make all` and then write `./assignment1.exe` into a terminal window. The program will automatically run the code on the file titled "input.txt". To change the input file, either edit "input.txt" with your desired input or delete the file. If you choose to delete the file, you will then be prompted to input the name of the file you want run the program on. The output will print the resulting indices for each question to the terminal.
