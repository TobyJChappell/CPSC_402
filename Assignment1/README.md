# Assignment 1
## Specification

DFA diagrams for each question are found in this repository and title 1.pdf, 2.pdf, and 3.pdf.

## Execution

To compile the program, type `make all` into the terminal. To execute the code, write `./assignment1.exe`. The program will automatically run the code on the file titled "input.txt". To change the input file, either edit "input.txt" to your desired string or delete the file and you will then be prompted to input the name of the file you want run on. The output will return the resulting indices for each question to the terminal.
