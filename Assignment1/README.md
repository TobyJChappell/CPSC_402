## Group Members

This assignment was completed by Toby Chappell, Jin Jung, Irene Liu, and Rose Ramirez.

## Specification

DFA diagrams for each question are found in this repository and titled 1.pdf, 2.pdf, and 3.pdf, each corresponding with their associated question number. The use of `*` is used to indicated an else branch, meaning it should be followed if no other branches can be taken.

## Execution

To compile and execute, type `make all` and then write `./assignment1.exe` into a terminal window. The program will automatically run the code on a test file titled "input.txt". To change the input, either edit "input.txt" with your desired string or delete the file. If you choose to delete the file, you will then be prompted to input the name of the file you want run the program on. The output will print the resulting indices for each question to the terminal.
